shalbum - http://sourceforge.net/projects/shalbum

Bourne shell script to create an HTML album from the image files in
current directory.
Customization can be achieved by editing the "Options" session in
this file.
Requires ImageMagick.

Usage (from your pictures directory), using default options:
 $ shalbum "Album Title" "Subtitle/Date"

For secodary default set of options (mhd) run:
 $ shalbum "Album Title" "Subtitle/Date" mhd

or:
 $ echo "Album Title" > _title
 $ echo "Date" > _date
 $ shalbum

for secondary default set of options run
 $ touch _mhd
before running shalbum.

You can alternatively bypass default options creating your own
_options file and puting it in your pictures directory. You can base
upon a commented _options file commonly distributed with shalbum.

 $ cp _options /my/pictures/directory
 <make some changes to it>
 $ cd /my/pictures/directory
 $ shalbum

You have also the option of including your own customized comments
under each picture using a _subtitles file in your pictures
directory. The syntax of this file must be as follows:

    FILENAME1.JPG=some description for this pic
    FILENAME2.JPG=other description for other pic

Note you "pic_label_type" must be set to "conf" for shalbum to
consider your _subtitles file.

To update only the HTML files:
 $ shalbum index
