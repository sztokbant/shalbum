1.) About shalbum

- Pure bourne shell script to create HTML photo galleries.

- Default options can be overridden with an _options file in the images
  directory.

- Requires ImageMagick - http://www.imagemagick.com.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.) Using shalbum


Usage (from your pictures directory), using default options:
 $ shalbum "Album Title" "Subtitle/Date"

For secodary default set of options - Mostly Harmless Decisions (mhd) run:
 $ shalbum "Album Title" "Subtitle/Date" mhd

or:
 $ echo "Album Title" > _title
 $ echo "Date" > _date
 $ shalbum

for secondary default set of options, Mostly Harmless Decisions (mhd) run:
 $ touch _mhd
before running shalbum.

You can alternatively bypass default options creating your own
_options file and puting it in your pictures directory. You can base
upon a commented _options file commonly distributed with shalbum.

 $ cp _options /my/pictures/directory
 <make some changes to it with your preferred editor>
 $ cd /my/pictures/directory
 $ shalbum

You have also the option of including your own customized comments
under each picture using a _subtitles file in your pictures
directory. The syntax of this file must be as follows:

    FILENAME1.JPG=some description for this pic
    FILENAME2.JPG=other description for other pic

Note you "pic_label_type" must be set to "conf" for shalbum to
consider your _subtitles file.

To update only the HTML files:
 $ shalbum index

3.) Note for non-Unix users (e.g. Windows)

It is known that shalbum runs very well on any Unix platform
containing ImageMagick and a bourne shell interpreter. I myself
already run it on Linux, FreeBSD and MacOS X. I also know about people
running shalbum on Microsoft Windows systems with CygWin, a Linux-like
environment for Windows.

Instructions on installing CygWin can be found at CygWin official
website - http://www.cygwin.com. Don't forget to Install a bourne
shell compatible interpreter and ImageMagick. I believe just selecting
'ImageMagick' and 'bash' packages during CygWin installation is
enough.

Once CygWin is installed shalbum shall run like on any other Unix.
